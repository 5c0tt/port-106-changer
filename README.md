#Port 106 Password Changer

A long time ago I ran an email server called EIMS.  It is garbage.  You could not change the password if you were the user, you had to email your admin and passwords ended up getting exchanged over email.

The developer does not care, and is still probably finding reasons of explaining why adding in SSL/TLS is not a good idea.

This script will talk to at the least, EIMS mail server, and change the password for  given user.  It is web enabled so the user need not talk to an a admin.
